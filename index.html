    <h1> Intro </h1>
    <p> Spending money once you get it? That’s what most people do.
    People, especially teens, often don't bother saving money and
    when they don’t, they somehow end up in the situation of having
    no idea as to why and how they spend so much money.
    So often people can’t get what they want, since they don’t have
    enough money.
    </p>

    <li> Why do we need financial planning?</li>
    <li> Why is it important?</li>
    <li> What are some problems without financial planning?</li>

    <h1> Financial Steps </h1>
    <p>In financial planning, exchanging ideas and advice
    is just 20% of the work, the rest 80% is about taking
    actions.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>Your financial plan is definitely only about
    setting your goal and finding a direction to achieve
    the goal. Setting goals and getting a direction is a
    very simple task, but sticking to your commitment will
    exhibit how serious you are towards attaining your goal.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h4>1. Set Goal</h4>
    <li> What do you want to do in the future?</li>
    <li> How much money do you need?</li>
    <li> Make sure the goal you want can be achieved.</li>

    <br>

    <h4>2. Where your money goes</h4>
    <li> How much money do you spend every month?</li>
    <li> Where do you spend the money?</li>

    <br>

    <h4>3. Implement the Plan</h4>
    <li> Start by saving little, and more each time.</li>

    <br>

    <h4>4. Get Employer Match(If you open business)</h4>
    <li> Does the employer match what you want and need?</li>
    <li> Does the employer help you make more money instead of losing?</li>

    <br>

    <h4>5. Back Up Plan</h4>
    <li> If you don’t have enough money, is there any extra money you can use?</li>
    <li>Deposit- a sum of money placed or kept in a bank account, usually to gain interest.</li>

    Financial Planning since it all revolved around numbers.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>&#9733 IRR, Mean, and Median</p>
    <p>&#9733 Different Equation</p>
    <p>&#9733 Geometry</p>
    <p>&#9733 Trigonometry</p>
    <p>&#9733 Arithmetic</p>
    <p>&#9733 Algebra</p>

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <h4>Investment Gains and Losses</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>In order to have good financial planning you
      will need to know how to calculate how much
      percent you gain and lose.
       <ul>
         <li>
           Let say if your original deposit is 2,000 a
           month and it increases to 2,600. It shows
           you have added 600 more to your deposit.
           Divide 600 by the original bill which is
           2,000 it will be equal to 0.3.
           This demonstrated you have gained 30%.
         </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br>

            percentage increase is required for their home to be
            worth the $250,000 that they originally paid for it.
            The difference between the current value and the
            original value is still $55,000 but the beginning
            balance is $195,000. When $55,000 is divided by
            $195,000, the result is 0.28 or 28% increase.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br>

            investor’s portfolio and earn 7 percent, 5 percent
            and 3 percent respectively. The weighted average
            return would be 5.6 percent calculated as follows:
            (.07 x .50) + (.05 x .30)+ (.03 x .20) = 3.5 percent +1.5 percent +0.6 percent
            after decimal points are moved two places to the right.

            inflation rate over time, an investor in the
            28 percent tax bracket would need to earn 5.6 percent → 4 /(1 - .28).
